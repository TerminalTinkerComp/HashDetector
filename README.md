# JustAHash
This Python script is designed as a simple command-line tool for users who want to determine which type of hash function was used based on a given input string that represents a hash value.

Copy code to your favorite Python coding Platform like PyCharm:
User has to input a hash value --> 
  1. If it recognizes the hash, it prints "Detected hash type: " where [hash_type] is the name of the recognized hashing algorithm.
  2. If it does not recognize the hash, it outputs "Detected hash type:  Not Known".
